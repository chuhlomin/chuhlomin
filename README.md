I'm a software engineer. Work at [The Atlantic](https://github.com/theatlantic).
I write about technologies and apps on my [microblog](https://chuhlomin.com/blog/index.html).

I like to work on transit-related projects like:
- [Transitër](https://transiter.app) – New York-only iOS app that shows public transit ETA
- [mta](https://github.com/errornil/mta) – Go library to work with New York MTA data
- [njtransit](https://github.com/errornil/njtransit) – Go library to work with NJTransit data

Some ops-related projects:
- [render-template](https://github.com/chuhlomin/render-template) – GitHub Action to create a file based on template and passed variables, can be used as simpler Helm alternative
- [actions](https://github.com/chuhlomin/actions) – GitHub Actions composite actions: `docker-build-push`, `deploy-gke`
- [ip](https://github.com/chuhlomin/ip) – Micro-service behind https://ip.chuhlomin.com/
- [timestamp](https://github.com/chuhlomin/timestamp) – Small VueJS app for working with timestamp in different formats. http://ts.chuhlomin.com/

Another project I'm worked on is a [protoc-gen-bq-schema "fork"](https://github.com/chuhlomin/protoc-gen-bq-schema) that adds comments from Protobuf to BigQuery Schema.
